UI repo for WanderLust
##MVP
    -My project is deployed here: https://wanderlust-home.netlify.com

    -What is WanderLust: We are travel enthusiasts, that saw a problem and created a solution! Wanderlust helps local tour guides of all types advertise their private/professional trips and experiences they offer. At the same time, giving travelers a place to plan out their trips and share their experiences!

    -WanderLust offers a one stop shop for both travelers and tourist services. Travelers have a place to plan and share their trip and get recommendations on future trips based on previous activity. Tour guides have a place to post their services for prospective travelers. Pictures taken and shared by other travelers using your service will post to your page!
    
    -Guides use Wanderlust to build their Touring Resume. Travelers can login, create read and update their trips with a trip type, location, duration and whether it's private or professional.
